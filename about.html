                <p>
                    <em>I Take Refuge</em> is a powerful documentary that sheds light on the untold journeys of refugee and immigrant women who have overcome unimaginable hardships to build a better life in the United States. Through the poignant stories of women like Claudine, Aminata, and Bridget, the film explores the themes of displacement, identity, and resilience. Each woman’s narrative is a testament to the strength and determination required to navigate the challenges of cultural adaptation, familial responsibility, and societal acceptance in their new homeland.

                    The documentary delves into the heart-wrenching experiences of fleeing war-torn regions, the struggle to find safety and stability, and the complex journey of embracing a new identity while holding on to cultural roots. Despite the prejudice and obstacles they face, these women emerge as some of the most successful and influential voices in their communities, proving that the immigrant experience is not just one of survival, but also of triumph.

                    <em>I Take Refuge</em> is a tribute to the courage and perseverance of millions of female refugees and immigrants who continue to make significant contributions to American society, while longing for a place to truly call home.

                <p>
                    My earliest memory of arriving in the United States is standing in an endless line with my family in the dead of winter for what felt like an eternity. At that moment, I was just a child, frustrated by the inconvenience, oblivious to the journey my parents had endured to bring us to that line. That line was our gateway to a new life—a line for our green cards. Little did I know then that this moment marked the beginning of a journey that would shape my understanding of freedom, identity, and resilience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ten years later, I found myself preparing for the citizenship exam, an experience that made me realize I had only glimpsed the surface of what it means to be a refugee in America. Though my homeland, Burundi, suffered through a devastating genocide, I was one of the fortunate ones who escaped relatively unscathed. Yet, as I grew older, I was drawn to other refugee and immigrant girls, now women, whose stories mirrored the struggles and triumphs of so many who seek refuge in the U.S.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the bonds of friendship, these incredible women entrusted me with their stories—tales of hardship, perseverance, and ultimately, survival. I came to understand that my story is but one thread in a vast tapestry of courage and resilience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this film, I invite you to journey alongside women who have crossed oceans, defied the odds, and fought for their place in the world. From a woman who survived two decades of relentless brutality in Congo to another who fled political strife in Guinea, to a first-generation immigrant who navigated the harsh realities her parents faced in Mexico and Colombia—these are the stories that must be heard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I aim to illuminate the profound challenges and indomitable spirit of refugee, immigrant, and first-generation women in the U.S. Through their voices, I hope to inspire awareness, empathy, and, most importantly, action.
